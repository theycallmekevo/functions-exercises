Assignment Reflection:

> I was a able to complete all of the mathematical functions and practiced better "googling" for helpful hints to solve the problems one step at a time. I helped other students as it helps me get more practice explaining the concepts, which in turn helps me better understand the fundamentals. I didn't have time to attempt the bonus question but will followup with questions after I have time to make a solid attempt, thank you.
